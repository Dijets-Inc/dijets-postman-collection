## Contributing

We aim to keep this repo up-to-date with [Dijets APIs](https://docs.dijets.io/docs/guides/node-apis/), with a view to later add [data visualizations](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/#visualizing-response-data). If you're able to help improve the Dijets Postman Collection in any way, first create a feature branch by branching off of `master`, next make the improvements on your feature branch and lastly create a [pull request](https://github.com/Dijets-Inc/dijets-postman-collection/) to merge your work back in to `master`.
